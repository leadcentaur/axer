## Install

```shell
go get -u github.com/leadcentaur/axer
```

## Basic Usage
You pass in a list of domains as input. The tool will then attempt to perform DNS zone transfer's for each domain in the list.
If sucessful, it will dump to the screen.

## Example input file domains.txt:

```shell
google.com
yahoo.com
nytimes.com
```
## Running the tool

```shell
go run axer.go -f domains.txt
```

Or

```shell
go run axer.go domains.txt
```
